#### [Lesson 01 - Time Complexity](https://github.com/samiulhoque/codility-lessons/blob/master/src/Lesson01/)
Use of time complexity makes it easy to estimate the running time of a program. Performing
an accurate calculation of a programâ€™s operation time is a very labour-intensive process
(it depends on the compiler and the type of computer or speed of the processor). Therefore, we
will not make an accurate measurement; just a measurement of a certain order of magnitude.
